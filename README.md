# My OpenGL Knowledge Using C++ Thus Far
This is the repository where I keep my personal version of the [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) content that I've learned.

As of now, the application consists of a fly-style camera with a cube and a spot light source in 3D space. You can fly around in the 3D space to check out the specular highlighting, but that's about it.

# How to View
If you have Visual Studio, you should be able to just clone the repository and run the solution file.

## Controls
#### W - _Forward_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S - _Backward_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A - _Left_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D - _Right_
